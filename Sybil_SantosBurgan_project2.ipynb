    "# Intro\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll continue working on your own image recognition system for classifying digits. Read through the code and the instructions carefully and add your own code where indicated. Each problem can be addressed succinctly with the included packages -- please don't add any more. \n",
    "As always, you're welcome to work on the project in groups and discuss ideas over Slack, but <b> please prepare your own write-up (with your own code). </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "---\n",
    " - Make sure to answer every part in every question.\n",
    " - There are 6 questions, each equally weighted and an additional bonus question.\n",
    " - The extra credit question will be graded based on your attempts at feature engineering and resulting improved accuracy.\n",
    " - Read carefully what is asked including the notes.\n",
    " - Additional points may be deducted if:\n",
    "   - the code is not clean, well commented,\n",
    "  -  if the functions or answers are too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "---\n",
    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Reading and notes\n",
    "---\n",
    "If you're interested, check out these links related to digit recognition:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Yann Lecun's MNIST benchmarks: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n",
    "* Stanford Streetview research and data: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you'd like to get started with Tensorflow, you can read through this tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification. It uses a dataset called \"fashion_mnist\", which is identical in structure to the original digit mnist, but uses images of clothing rather than images of digits. The number of training examples and number of labels is the same. In fact, you can simply replace the code that loads \"fashion_mnist\" with \"mnist\" and everything should work fine."

    "### Question 1: Applying a smoothing using numpy.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A common image processing technique is to smooth an image by **blurring**. The idea is that the value of a particular pixel is estimated as the weighted combination of the original value and the values around it. Typically, the blurring is Gaussian, i.e., the weight of a pixel's influence is determined by a Gaussian function over the distance to the relevant pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a simplified Gaussian blur filter by just using the 8 neighboring pixels like this: the smoothed value of a pixel is a weighted combination of the original value and the 8 neighboring values.\n",
    "1. Choose some weights as a starting point. Produce and evaluate four 1-Nearest Neighbor models by applying your blur filter in these ways:\n",
    "  1. Do not use the filter\n",
    "  1. Filter the training data but not the dev data\n",
    "  1. Filter the dev data but not the training data\n",
    "  1. Filter both training data and dev data\n",
    "1. Show the accuracies of the four models evaluated as described. What do you see? Can you explain why this is?\n",
    "1. Experiment with weights that makes one model's accuracy at least 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the (filtered) mini train set.\n",
    "* Evaluate performance on the (filtered) dev set.\n",
    "* A good trick to simplify your code is to use numpy's pad function to add 0s around your original array so you don't have to deal with \"edge cases\".\n",
    "* In addition, you can use numpy to multiply and sum slices of two arrays.\n",
    "* [This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eJXTQLtREXQjQIsLOA9uCrBl6B049-pO) might help shows some example numpy code.\n",
    "* In general, [numpy operations will be much faster than for loops](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KJI4JtuIqVdyZHTTe_mAlKYA5XdLFp3_). \n",
    "* There are other Guassian blur filters available, for example in `scipy.ndimage.filters`. You are welcome to experiment with those, but in this question, please implement your own."
