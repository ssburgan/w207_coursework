    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "The `sklearn` documentation on feature extraction may be useful:\n",

    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",

    "#### ANSWER: \n",
    "**Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm assumes similar things exist in close proximity. Because KNN does not have a training phases it uses all of the data. When vectorized the text produces a high dimentional data set. This means the size of the data points start getting father and father apart from each other. K-nearest neighbors requires a point to be close in every single dimension. Sparsity in the data set make it difficult to make predictions accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a generative model that models the joint distribution of the features and then predicts the posterior probability. Logistic regression is a discriminative model which learns the probability of a sample belonging to a certain class and tries to find the optimal decision boundary that best separates the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes assumes all the features to be conditionally independent. If features are dependent on each other the prediction might be poor. Logistic regression splits feature space linearly even when some of the variables are correlated. This might have a negative impact on prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of squares is the sum of the square of variation where variation is the spread between the individual values and the mean. It is used to determine the best fit line. The C value hyperperamer adjusts regulation strength. It allows for a complexity pentalty for more extreme parameters. Extreme parameters in training data can lead to overfitting. A high C value tells the model to give weight to the training data and a lower weight to the complexity pentalty - trust the training data. A low C value gives more weight to complexity penalty at the expense of fitting to training data. In the Logistic models you can see the sum of square values increasing as C increases and f1 score decreasing. This is the spread increasing between the best fit line. The model is overfitting to the training data and impacting predection negatively. "

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",

    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",

      "    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\n",
      "    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\n",

      "    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\n",
      "    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\n",
      "    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\n",
      "    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\n",

      "\n",

    "CountVectorizer counts the number of times a word appears in the document. This results in a bias towards most frequent words and ignoring rare words which could improve prediction. TF-IDF focuses on the frequency of words present in the corpus but also provides the importance of the words by looking at the inverse frequency across all documents. We can then remove the words that are less important for analysis, making the model building less complex by reducing the input dimensions.\n",

Perhaps these rare words are not important for analysis. Perhaps there is a way to adjust the TfidfVectorizer modify the influence of rare words. "
