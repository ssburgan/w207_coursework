    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "The sum of squares is the sum of the square of variation where variation is the spread between the individual values and the mean. It is used to determine the line of best fit. The C value hyperperamer adjusts regulation strength. It allows for a complexity pentalty for more extreme parameters. Extreme parameters in training data can lead to overfitting. A high C value tells the model to give weight to the training data and a lower weight to the compelxity pentalty - trust the training data. A low C value gives more weight to complexity penalty at the expense of fitting to training data. In the Logistic models you can see the sum of square values increasing as C increases. This is the spread increasing between the best fit line. The model is overfitting to the training data. "

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
