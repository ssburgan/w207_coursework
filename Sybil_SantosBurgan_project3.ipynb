    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "The sum of squares is the sum of the square of variation where variation is the spread between the individual values and the mean. It is used to determine the line of best fit. The C value hyperperamer adjusts regulation strength. It allows for a complexity pentalty for more extreme parameters. Extreme parameters in training data can lead to overfitting. A high C value tells the model to give weight to the training data and a lower weight to the complexity pentalty - trust the training data. A low C value gives more weight to complexity penalty at the expense of fitting to training data. In the Logistic models you can see the sum of square values increasing as C increases. This is the spread increasing between the best fit line. The model is overfitting to the training data. "

    "### Question 6: L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
    "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
    "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
    "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* No need to apply pre-processing from question 5.\n",
    "* Train on the transformed (i.e. CountVectorizer) training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data (using the CountVectorizer instance you trained on the training data).\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
    "* (solver=\"liblinear\" might be needed for it not to crash)"

      "    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\n",
      "    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\n",
      "    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\n",

      "    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\n",
      "    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\n",
      "    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\n",
      "    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\n",

      "    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\n",
      "    not be your real intent.\n",
      "\n",
